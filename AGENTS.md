# AGENTS.md — layer-himalaya

Standalone candy repo for the `himalaya` layer — the IMAP/SMTP email CLI,
`cargo install`ed from crates.io into the user's cargo bin. The candy lives in
`charly.yml` at the repo root: the `rust` require, the `run:` install step, the
`check:` assertions, and the embedded `skill:` entity projected into the
marketplace corpus as `/charly-tools:himalaya`.

Canonical files:

- `charly.yml` — the `himalaya:` candy entity and the `himalaya-skill:` skill
  entity.
- `CHANGELOG/` — per-CalVer release history; read it before changing baked
  checks.
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` — CalVer tag + `CHANGELOG/` on merge.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-tools:himalaya` — the owning skill. The `cargo install` path and
  verification. Load before editing or troubleshooting the layer.
- `/charly-image:layer` — the candy authoring reference (`charly.yml` schema,
  `plan:` step verbs incl. `check:`/`run:`, per-distro `distro:` arms,
  package/repo sections). Load before editing any entity field or plan step.

## Build / validate / test

- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no
  per-repo candy gate** and ships only `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml`.
- The candy's `plan:` `check:` steps are the functional evidence; they must stay
  valid on every distro arm they run on. Scope a distro-specific check in the
  command itself — the check runner does not honour runner-level
  `exclude-distro` fields.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `himalaya:` candy entity AND the `himalaya-skill:` skill entity in
  `charly.yml` together. The skill is the projected usage source, so a behaviour
  change not mirrored in the skill leaves the corpus stale.
- The install is a `run:` step (`cargo install himalaya`); behaviour claims
  belong in the `plan:` as an observable `check:` step, and in the skill body.
- Keep the `check:` binary path in sync with the `rust` candy's cargo-bin `PATH`
  wiring.

## Landing

- PR-only. Every change lands through a pull request; the org-required
  `charly/pr-validator` validates the diff and body and arms native auto-merge
  on PASS. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- History lives in `CHANGELOG/` (written by `tag-on-merge` at merge time); the
  PR body IS the changelog.
- The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
  `opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo. Do not
  restate its rules here.
